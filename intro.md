# Hello! Hidwejatan!

this is my language. it's made to showcase my feelings and personality. this means inside, you'll find:
- poorly made systems
- bad jokes
- and words for different types of gender dysphoria-infused meltdowns!

you'll learn how to make sentences such as "far far-ka-n-et-d'insen-d'oten wen-ot-far-mas-uf-et-im"

*but why is Amirum the 'language of love'? love is for everyone, but your worldview is only yours!* - to this made-up, yet not false claim i respond: this is just *"Cheriljak Amirum"*, you are encouraged to make your own dialect, or sibling language!
