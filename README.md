# Cheryllian-branch Amirum

# Hello! Hidwejatan!

this is my language. it's made to showcase my feelings and personality. this means inside, you'll find:
- poorly made systems
- bad jokes
- and words for different types of meltdowns!

you'll learn how to make sentences such as "far far-ka-n-et-d'insen-d'oten wen-ot-far-mas-uf-et-im"

*but why is Amirum the 'language of love'? love is for everyone, but your worldview is only yours!* - to this made-up, yet not false claim i respond: this is just *"Cheriljak Amirum"*, you are encouraged to make your own dialect, or sibling language!

# syntax

the word order is free, but if the direct object goes after the nominative, it is not marked.

adjectives/adverbs go before their corresponding nouns/verbs

# affixes

 *note- if an affix/word ends in -j (noj, -bej, soj), it gets strengthened to -s if you put an affix after it (nos-en, amiri-bes-ej, sos-d'insen)

## part 1: nouns!

nouns have affixes, from 0 to any number you want

these are:
- -(e)n → locative, indirect object, allative
- -(e)j → direct object
- -d'insen → inessive, illative
- -d'oten → ablative, elative
- -ka → cause
- -tsa → for (the benefit of)
- -sa → like (sth)
- -jak → property of (sb)
- suf- → vocative
- mja- → big!!! :O
- lij- → tiny 'v'

## part 2: verbs!

verbs also have affixes, and again, from 0 to any number you want

these are:
- ot- → future
- wen- → past
- -lox → simple aspect
- -(i/j)m → volitive form
- -(e)te → potential form
- suf- → imperative (as in "DO X!")
- -suf → imperative (as in "i must do x")
- -maj → causative, help form
- -bej → doer
- -(e)k → receiver

## part 3: adjectives! (optional)
- amfa- → very little
- imfa- → kinda
- umfa- → normally
- onta- → a lot
- emfa- → too much

these can be combined. if you combine multiple noun affixes, they're treated as the same noun with different cases. *"far"* means flower/bloom/transgender/transition. translate this: "far far-ka-n-et-d'insen-d'oten wen-ot-far-mas-uf-et-im"

for the lazy, it's "a trans person was going to make a trans person transition on a flower, because of (their) transness from the trans person into the trans person"

# gender

you can only refer to nouns or verbs gendered the same as you.

luckily all words are every gender at once.

### no, but seriously speaking

gender is it's own suffix system. you can use them optionally. if you speak a gendered language, you can gender stuff as how they're gendered in your language, that is, if you wanna be looked at like a dumbass.

here's a chart:

| gender | best approximation (gender can get fuzzy) |
|---|---|
| boy | togre |
| girl | frere |
| nonbinary (your own gender, unrelated to the binary ones) | njowre |
| agender | nansre |
| pangender | canezansre |
| somewhere in between | insare |
| two-spirit | terere |
| three-spirit | canre |
